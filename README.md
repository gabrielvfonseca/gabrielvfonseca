I am a computer science student, experienced in building different types of applications with many different technologies.
I define myself as a self-taught person always looking for self-improvement and new ways to be challenged.
My most skilled area of expertise is full-stack although I've been currently working with machine learning algorithms.

App stack: => {vscode <3, postman, hyper, notion, tableplus, docker, ...}
<br />
Code written in: => {Python, PHP, js, node, typescript, react, next, tailwindcss, ... }
