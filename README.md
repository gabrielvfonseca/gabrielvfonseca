# Hey
Computer Science Engineering Student | Software Developer | Technology enthusiast


My name is João Gabriel Fonseca.

I am currently balancing multiple exciting endeavors. While pursuing my degree in Computer Science Engineering, I am gaining practical experience by working part-time at a dynamic web and app development agency. Additionally, I embrace freelancing opportunities to further expand my skill set and explore diverse projects. Beyond my professional commitments, I am an avid content creator, sharing my insights and experiences on my website and LinkedIn profile. 

My passion for technology extends beyond the workplace, as I actively attend technological events and continually bring my innovative ideas to life through personal projects.
