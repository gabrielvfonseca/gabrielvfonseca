Hey there! 

I’m a Computer Engineering student at NOVA School of Science and Technology in Lisbon, Portugal, with a solid foundation in software development—shaped by both academic experience and self-driven projects.

Currently, I’m building an AI-powered platform designed to help businesses align teams, make data-driven decisions, gain insights, streamline operations, and execute projects with clarity. As the founder, my focus is on product development, user research, and laying the groundwork to bring this vision to life.

Beyond my startup, I work on freelance and personal projects in full-stack development, always aiming to combine creativity with technical skills to solve real-world problems. I stay engaged with the tech, business, and startup communities, and I’m always learning, experimenting, and iterating.

I’m open to connecting with fellow builders, potential collaborators, and anyone interested in AI, productivity, and organizational clarity.
