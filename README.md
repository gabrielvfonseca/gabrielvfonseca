# Gabriel Fonseca

I am a computer science student, experienced in building different types of applications with many different technologies.
I define myself as a self-taught person always looking for self-improvement and new ways to be challenged.
My most skilled area of expertise is full-stack although I've been currently working with machine learning algorithms.
