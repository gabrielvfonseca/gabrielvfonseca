Computer Engineering Student @NOVA SST | Software Developer | Technology enthusiast

Hey there! I've always believed that the best way to learn is by taking the long, sometimes harder route. That's why I created this space â€” to document and share my journey, thoughts, and passions. I may not always be sure if this is the best use of my time, but it feels right to be authentic and speak my truth.

I am currently working towards a degree in Computer Engineering at the NOVA School of Science and Technology (NOVA SST) in Lisbon, Portugal. I relish the opportunity to attend tech conferences and events whenever possible, as they provide valuable insights from leading products and industry experts. My enthusiasm is driven by constantly exploring new ideas and transforming innovative projects into reality.

I probably sound like your typical tech enthusiast nerd, and I am. But that's okay. I'm here to share my journey, thoughts, and passions.
