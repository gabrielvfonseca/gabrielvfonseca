Hey there! 

I am currently working towards a degree in Computer Engineering at the NOVA School of Science and Technology (NOVA SST) in Lisbon, Portugal. 

I relish the opportunity to attend tech conferences and events whenever possible, as they provide valuable insights from leading products and industry experts. My enthusiasm is driven by constantly exploring [new ideas](https://gabfon.com/notes) and transforming innovative [projects](https://gabfon.com/projects) into reality.
