Hey there! 

I’m a Computer Engineering student at NOVA SST in Lisbon with a strong foundation in software development—shaped by both academic work and self-driven projects.

Currently, I’m building Frontal, an AI-powered platform that helps businesses align teams, make data-driven decisions, and execute with clarity. As founder, I’m focused on product development, user research, and turning this vision into reality.

Beyond my startup, I take on freelance and personal projects in full-stack development, combining creativity and technical expertise to solve real-world problems. I stay active in tech, business, and startup communities, constantly learning, experimenting, and iterating.

I’m always open to connecting with fellow builders, collaborators, and anyone interested in AI, productivity, and organizational clarity.
